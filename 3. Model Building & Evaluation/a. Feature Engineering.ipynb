    "# Feature Engineering Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "This plan outlines the key features to be engineered for distinguishing between human and AI-generated texts, focusing on linguistic, readability, n-gram, emotional and semantic coherence. These features aim to capture the differentiation between AI from human writing styles and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Linguistic Features\n",
    "These features aim to capture the essence of how texts are constructed, focusing on the structural and lexical aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntactic Complexity**: Syntactic complexity looks at how complex the structure of sentences is. Since AI might not always mimic the wide range of ways humans put sentences together, this aspect is key in figuring out who wrote something, highlighting the skillful way words are woven together (Lu, 2010).\n",
    "- **Lexical Richness**: Lexical richness is about the variety of words used. AI-written texts might use words differently because of what they've learned from their data, so looking at the Type-Token Ratio (TTR) and other similar measures can point out differences in how complex and unique the text is (McCarthy and Jarvis, 2010).\n",
    "- **Burstiness**: Burstiness tells us about how often different words are used in a text, shedding light on whether the language feels natural or machine-made. This can help spot the unique patterns AI uses in creating text (Church and Gale, 1995).\n",
    "- **Perplexity**: Perplexity measures how predictable a text is, with AI-written texts often being more predictable because of how their algorithms tend to pick more expected words (Juola, 2006). This is checked here, using a language model - GPT-2.\n",
    "- **Semantic Coherence**: Semantic coherence is all about how logically and consistently ideas are connected. Human writing usually flows better and links ideas more smoothly than AI, which can sometimes jump from one idea to another less gracefully..\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Readability Feature\n",
    "Readability scores help figure out how easy or hard a text is to understand. Since AI might not really focus on making texts match certain levels of difficulty the way people do, checking these scores can point out texts where the difficulty level hasn't been adjusted on purpose by a human writer (Kincaid et al., 1975).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. N-Gram Feature\n",
    "Looking at n-grams, which are groups of words that appear together, helps us see patterns in language that are important for figuring out who wrote something. AI-written texts might keep using the same n-grams over and over because those are the ones they learned from their data, showing a different pattern than texts written by people (Stamatatos, 2009). Hence, checking unique N-grams here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sentiment Feature\n",
    "Sentiment analysis checks the emotional tone of texts. People can write with a rich mix of emotions, but AI might either not get the subtlety right or might show emotions in a more predictable way. This difference can help us tell apart texts written by humans from those generated by AI (Liu, 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these specialized methods, we're working on building a solid system that can tell the difference between the intricate details of human-written texts and those created by AI, helping us better understand how artificial content stacks up against human creativity."
